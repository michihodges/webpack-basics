# Webpack Basics
A walkthrough for setting up Webpack for an Express based web app.

## Introduction
The aim of this GitHub repository is to provide a concise working template to kick start a Webpack based web app as well as a thorough and easy to follow walkthrough for setting up Webpack from scratch. These aims are split into two categories; Template and Walkthrough. Template essentially skips the explanation of each step and purely focuses on getting a project started, whereas Walkthrough categorises and describes each step in detail. Template has everything required on this page (the main branch) to get started. Walkthrough has links that can be navigated to in the branch navigation at the top and within the separate section introductions at the bottom of this document.

## Walkthrough
[01-node](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/01-node) starts with Node.js explaining why version 14 is so important for this Webpack setup, how to install v14 or if necessary how to download Node Version Manager and configure v14 as the default version.

[02-express](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/02-express) introduces the Node Package Manager which comes pre-installed with Node.js with which the packages Express.js, Body-Parser and CORS are installed to easily set up a local server.

[03-webpack](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/03-webpack) kicks off with the initial setup for Webpack, what to install, why they should be installed, which files to create and how to configure them.
