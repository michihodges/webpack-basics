# Webpack Basics
A walkthrough for setting up Webpack for an Express based web app.

## Introduction
The aim of this GitHub repository is to provide a concise working template to kick start a Webpack based web app as well as a thorough and easy to follow walkthrough for setting up Webpack from scratch. These aims can be split into two categories; Template and Walkthrough. Template essentially skips the explaination of each step and purely focuses on getting a project started, whereas Walkthrough categorises and describes each step in detail. With Template, everything required is on this page and on the main branch. With Walkthrough, each branch will need to be navigated to by either the links below or the branch navigation bar at the top which is currently on main.
