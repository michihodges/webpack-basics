# Webpack Basics
A walkthrough for setting up Webpack for an Express based web app.

## Introduction
The aim of this GitHub repository is to provide a concise working template to kick start a Webpack based web app as well as a thorough and easy to follow walkthrough for setting up Webpack from scratch. These aims are split into two categories; Template and Walkthrough. Template essentially skips the explanation of each step and purely focuses on getting a project started, whereas Walkthrough categorises and describes each step in detail. Template has everything required on this page (the main branch) to get started. Walkthrough has links that can be navigated to in the branch navigation at the top and within the separate section introductions at the bottom of this document.

## Walkthrough
If Node.js version 14 has not been installed yet, either install it now if no other Node version exists or download the Node Version Manager to install and configure v14. Branch [01-node](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/01-node) will explain why v14 is important for this Webpack set up and how to proceed.
