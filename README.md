# Webpack Basics
A walkthrough for setting up Webpack from scratch. To navigate this GitHub repository, either use the branch navigation at the top which is currently on 'main' or use the linked introductions below: 

## Branches
[01-node](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/01-node) starts with Node.js, explains why version 14 is so important for this Webpack setup, how to install v14 or if necessary how to download Node Version Manager and configure v14 as the default version.

[02-express](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/02-express) introduces the Node Package Manager which comes pre-installed with Node.js with which the packages Express.js, Body-Parser and CORS are installed to easily set up a local server. An example project is also provided to see where things fit together.

[03-webpack](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/03-webpack) kicks off with the initial setup for Webpack, what to install, why they should be installed, which files to create and how to configure them. A more advanced example project is provided to see how things fit together.

[04-webpack-entry](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/04-webpack-entry) reconfigures the default entry point in order for it to work and build a distribution folder with some test content inside. This is the beiginning of what is possible with Webpack.

[05-webpack-loaders](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/05-webpack-loaders) dives into loaders, what they are, what they do and how to integrate them. Babel will be used as an example loader, which is essential for building and publishing modern web apps today.

[06-webpack-plugins](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/06-webpack-plugins) explains what plugins are, how to configure them and how they differ from loaders. Html-Webpack-Plugin will be used as an example plugin, demonstrating how useful and advantagous plugins can be.

[07-webpack-mode](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/07-webpack-mode) covers the setting up of the development and production modes. The benefits of using different working environments is demonstrated by implementing tools that either assist development or optimise code for production.

[08-webpack-convenience](https://github.com/michihodges/webpack-basics/tree/08-webpack-convenience) builds upon the knowledge of Webpack modes and optimises development mode further with the Webpack-Dev-Server and the Clean-Webpack-Plugin packages.
